# Lab 1
## Introduction

This lab prepares materials needed for the semesters' lab assignments, reviews techniques/procedures required for professional laboratory work, and provides experience using a function generator, power supply, oscilloscope, and multimeter. Each resistor utilized in this lab was analyzed to determine the precise resistance each provided. These measurements demonstrated that each resistor did not contain the exact resistance advertized along the resistors' bodies. Afterward, the function generator was utilized alongside the oscilloscope to demonstrate how the changes in the function generator impact the output displayed on the oscilloscope. The oscilloscope displayed the sine wave and the magnitude spectrum input by the function generator. This measurement process continued throughout the experiment to measure Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, and Figure 1.3, as seen below.

The Pre-Lab Analysis performed before the experiment aligned with the experiment, aside from slight differences discussed in the body of this report. A Spice simulation was also performed on Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, and Figure 1.3.

## Pre-Lab Analysis
Provide a summary of your pre-lab calculations, focusing specifically on the calculations that affect your experimental
design. Note that some calculations are purely instructive; only include them in the report if they directly affect your
experiment. If you performed experiment X and plan to write about it in the report, then you should fully describe any
pre-lab analysis related to X.

## Simulation Results
If the lab includes a session with the SPICE simulator, place the results here. Again, you do not need to be exhaustive.
Focus on what is important. If you are reporting on specific experiment X, then provide the simulation results related to
X and explain how they match with the pre-lab analysis related to X. All of your sections should tie-in with each other.

## Experimental Results
Here’s the part where you place your actual measurements. If you choose to discuss experiment X, then provide
quantitative data resulting from the experiment, and compare those results to the predictions made in pre-lab analysis
and simulation.

## Conclusions
In this section, provide a summary and interpretation of your results. If your experimental results did not match your
predictions, then offer plausible hypotheses to explain the discrepancy. If your results point toward a grand conclusion or generalization, state it here. Explain your results with reference to the stated objectives of the lab. Were there any noteworthy
or unusual observations that arose from the experiments? Did your results match theoretical expectations? If
not, give reasonable hypotheses as to what might have gone wrong. Support your hypotheses with plausible
arguments.

## Appendix: Data Tables
If you need to include data tables in the report, place them in an appendix at the end. The main body of your report
should not be over-burdened with minutia. The report should communicate knowledge and insights. The minutia can
go at the end for the reader’s reference. Record careful tables of numerical results. Always record units and precision for experimental measurements.
